# Printer Properties To Bin file
Save Printer Properties to a Bin file to use in another applications.
This is a stripped down version of code from this webpage (https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/488737/Storing-and-Recalling-Printer-Settings-in-Csharp-N).
I converted it to a small .Net 6 WPF MVVM project and removed some functionality like the array/file comparision and reduced stores down to 2.
