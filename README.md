# Printer Properties To Bin
Save Printer Properties to Bin file
This is a stripped down version of code from this webpage (https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/488737/Storing-and-Recalling-Printer-Settings-in-Csharp-N)
I converted it to a small WPF MVVM project and removed some functionality like the array/file comparision and reduced to stores down to 2.
